Application for converting between geospatial raster formats. 

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6

## Overview
`geoconverter` is an application built for simple conversion between geospatial raster formats. It leverages [gdal](https://gdal.org/) for handling the geospatial rasters and a [fork](https://github.com/ahuarte47/cesium-terrain-builder) of [cesium-terrain-builder](https://github.com/geo-data/cesium-terrain-builder) for cesium terrain formats.
